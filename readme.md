# Boid Simulation and Analysis
A Python-based Boid Simulation demonstrating flocking behaviors using Tkinter, NumPy, and Pandas. This simulation allows users to create multiple flocks with customizable parameters and export simulation data for further analysis. Data_analysis folder contain jupyter notebook files for data analysis using machine learning models to detect flocks.

# Features
<ul>
<li>

**Simulation:** Used to observe flocking behaviors similar to the wild where flocks can converge and seperate depending on where they were originally routing from.</li>
<li>**Data Analysis:** Observe flocks with no actual data of where the flock is to analysis and find ground truth by comparing flock id from the simulation and the predictive analysis based on machine learning algorithms.
